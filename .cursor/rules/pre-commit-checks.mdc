# Pre-Commit Quality Checks

Before committing any changes to this Rust project, always run the following checks:

## Required Pre-Commit Commands

1. **Format code with rustfmt:**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   ```

2. **Run clippy for linting:**
   ```bash
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure nothing is broken:**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Workflow

The recommended pre-commit workflow is:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for linting issues
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test

# If all checks pass, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## CI/CD Integration

These same checks should be enforced in GitHub Actions workflows to ensure consistency across all contributions.

## Notes

- Use `cargo fmt` to automatically fix formatting issues
- Address all clippy warnings before committing
- Ensure all tests pass before pushing changes
- Consider using git hooks to automate these checks
